> To create a game for mobile which encorages creativity, sharing, and critical thinking, while still being a fun platformer.
```
Not enough games on mobile are like this. The "Play, Create, Share" idea from the PS3 should be a centerpiece of this project.
I'm starting with why, because without why, I can't shape the "what".
```

## Game
1. It needs to above all be fun.
2. If it's not fun, what's the point, no one wants to play that.
3. Jumping needs to be fun to do.
4. Walking back and forth should be satisfying.
5. Every action should be fun to do, not annoying or tedious.
6. If an action stays annoying, or even not enjoyable, it needs to be changed or even redone.

## Creativity
```
Creativity is encouraged by having a create mode for the game, the creative mode should have restrictions, forcing you to use your brain.
That helps with critical thinking.
