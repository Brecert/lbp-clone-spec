Sharing

Levels you make can be shared to your hub.

The hub is an area for all your levels to be displayed.

There are four options for the hub.

1. Planets (each planet is a level)
2. Planet (the planet contains all of the levels)
3. 2Dish Area (a 2Dish sculptable area of space)
4. Level (a level that a user submits as their hub)
